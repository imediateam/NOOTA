# About This File

It was created by Apple Inc. for tvOS beta  and iOS beta. So if we install it into our iPhone ,the our iPhone would not check update info (because the platform is wrong , tvOS â‰  iOS).

So install iOS beta profile into your Apple TV , and install tvOS beta profile into iOS . They would block both system update check.
